title: Squeezing Water from Stone - KornShell in 2019

At FOSDEM 2019 I gave a brief status update about state of AT&T KornShell. [Video][fosdem-video] of my talk is now available at FOSDEM website. I mostly talked about what makes ksh so challenging to maintain and about the steps current upstream maintainers have taken to revive it. If you want to provide feedback, feel free to drop me an e-mail or give me a shout on Twitter.

Edit: I gave an updated version of this talk at [All Systems Go! 2019][asg-video].
